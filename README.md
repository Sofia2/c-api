## API documentation

The documentation of the C API is published at http://sofia2.github.io/c-api/.

Before using the SSAP API for the first time, we strongly recommend that you learn the main concepts of the Sofia2 platform. They have been included in the Sofia2 developer documentation, which can be downloaded from http://sofia2.com/desarrollador_en.html.

The folder [examples](examples) contains usage examples of the whole API. These examples are automatically compiled during the project build, and make use of the Sofia2 experimentation instance (http://sofia2.com).

If you want to test this API, we encourage you to register here, to create your own ontologies and client applications and to modify the examples as much as you wish.

## Repository contents

This repository contains the following directories:

* [paho-mqtt-c](paho-mqtt-c): this directory contains the Eclipse Paho C MQTT client library.
* [cjson](cjson): this directory contains a library to manipulate JSON objects from C code. You should use it to manipulate the SSAP messages generated by the API.
* [ssap](ssap): this directory contains the SSAP C API itself.
* [Windows Build](Windows Build): this directory contains a Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 solution that builds the SSAP API DLL files and the examples.
* [examples](examples): this directory contains usage examples of the whole API. These examples are also integrated in the examples section of the API documentation.
